# Neural Operator Simulator

## Overview

The **Neural Operator Simulator** is a Streamlit-based interactive application designed to simulate material behavior using a trained neural operator model. Users can input a hotspot location and choose a material type (e.g., Steel, Iron, Aluminum). Based on these inputs, the model generates the corresponding distribution originating from the selected hotspot.

This project demonstrates the integration of PyTorch-based neural operator inference within an intuitive Streamlit web interface.

## Features

* **User Input:**

  * Enter hotspot coordinates (X, Y).
  * Select material type (Steel, Iron, Aluminum).
* **Model Inference:**

  * Loads a trained PyTorch model (saved with `state_dict`).
  * Generates a distribution map from the given hotspot and material properties.
* **Interactive Visualization:**

  * Displays model output in real-time using Streamlit.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
python >= 3.8
pytorch >= 1.13
streamlit >= 1.25
matplotlib
numpy
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Application

To start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will launch the app in your default browser.

## Usage

1. Launch the app using `streamlit run main.py`.
2. Input **hotspot coordinates** (X, Y).
3. Select **material type** from the dropdown menu.
4. Click **Simulate** to generate the distribution.
5. View the distribution output plot generated by the model.

---

## Notes

* The PyTorch model is loaded using:

  ```python
  model = ModelClass()
  model.load_state_dict(torch.load("saved_model.pth", map_location=device))
  model.eval()
  ```
* The app uses `matplotlib` or `streamlit.pyplot` for visualizing the results.
* Make sure the trained model file (`saved_model.pth`) is placed in the project root directory.

---

## Future Improvements

* Extend to support additional materials.
* Allow 3D visualization of distributions.
* Enable exporting results to image/PDF format.
